## Cost and CO2 baseline 

You are currently working with 20(?) product categories, in the graphs below you can see the share of cost (€) for each category as well as the estimated share of carbon emission (CO2/1€) for each category. 

## The first Chart from chart.js

<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>

<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Setup.js" | relative_url }}"></script>
<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Config.js" | relative_url }}"></script>

<script>
  // === include 'setup' then 'config' above ===

  const myChart = new Chart(
    document.getElementById('myChart'),
    config
  );
</script>


## The Second Chart from chart.js

<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>

<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Setup.js" | relative_url }}"></script>
<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Config.js" | relative_url }}"></script>

<script>
  // === include 'setup' then 'config' above ===

  const myChart = new Chart(
    document.getElementById('myChart'),
    config
  );
</script>

## Combined cost and CO2 impact 

By multiplying the carbon emission (CO2/1€) for a category with your total cost for the category, we can see the relative impact of each category on the combined bottom line of your organisation and the planet. 


## The Third Chart from chart.js

<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>

<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Setup.js" | relative_url }}"></script>
<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Config.js" | relative_url }}"></script>

<script>
  // === include 'setup' then 'config' above ===

  const myChart = new Chart(
    document.getElementById('myChart'),
    config
  );
</script>

## Opportunities and recommendations 

Within your procured categories, there are 5(?) categories in particular that account for 70%(?) of your combined cost and CO2 emissions. If these categories are absolutely essential to your business, we'd strongly recommend considering an alternative vendor with lower CO2 emissions and neutral or lower price, click here to see a comparison of similar vendors (dead link).

## The Fourth Chart from chart.js

<div>
  <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
</div>

<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Setup.js" | relative_url }}"></script>
<script src="{{ "/assets/js/Config.js" | relative_url }}"></script>

<script>
  // === include 'setup' then 'config' above ===

  const myChart = new Chart(
    document.getElementById('myChart'),
    config
  );
</script>
